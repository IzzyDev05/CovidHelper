1) Open cmd and check your version of python by typing "python". In my case it is 3.9.6 (And 64 bit)

2) Go here: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio

3) Download the corresponding version (In my case, that would be "PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp39‑cp39‑win_amd64.whl")

4) Open the folder where you installed the file. Then, in the path (Where it says the disk location), type in cmd to open command prompt inside that directory.

5) Type in "pip install Py" and then press TAB until it autocompletes to the downloaded whl file. Press enter to download
